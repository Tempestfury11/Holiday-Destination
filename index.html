    <ul>
        <li>Football is a big part of my life so the first thing would be to watch some live BPL matches</li>
        <li>The next thing i would love to do would be to go on a tour on one of those city tour buses</li>
        <li>What would a holiday be without going to see some landmarks like Big Ben?</li>
        <li>Next on the list would be to go on a tour at the Stamford Bridge Stadium home of Chelsea FC</li>
        <li>Last on the list would be to catch the night life of the club scene</li>
    </ul>
